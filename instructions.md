# Adding Your Student Code Full Name to `conflictos.md`

---

Dear Students,

In order to keep track of contributions and avoid conflicts in our collaborative project, it's crucial that each one of you adds your full name along with your student code to the `conflictos.md` file. This file serves as a record of all contributors, ensuring transparency and clarity in our work.

Here are the steps you need to follow to add your information:

1. **Locate the `conflictos.md` file**: You can find this file in the root directory of our project repository.

2. **Open `conflictos.md`**: Use a text editor or navigate to the file through your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) or Git client.

3. **Add a new line**: Scroll to the end of the file and add a new line.

4. **Format your entry**: Each entry should be in the following format:
   
`[Student Code] - [Full Name]`


Replace `[Student Code]` with your unique student code and `[Full Name]` with your complete name.

5. **Save your changes**: Once you've added your information, save the file.

6. **Commit and push your changes**: If you're using version control (such as Git), commit your changes and push them to the remote repository. This ensures that your contribution is saved and visible to everyone working on the project.

By following these steps, you'll help maintain organization and prevent conflicts as we collaborate on our project.

Thank you for your cooperation!
